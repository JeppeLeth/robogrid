The project is split into 3 parts
  - Grid core: Plain java engine for controlling the grid creation, logic and reporting through an interface.
  - Java console: Simple commandline interface for textual interaction with the grid.
  - Android app: UI interface for graphical interaction with the grid.

> **Tip:** Check out the examples in [Console](/console/README.MD) section and [App](/app/README.MD) for a description of the different input formats.
